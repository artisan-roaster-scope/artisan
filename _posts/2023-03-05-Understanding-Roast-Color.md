Taking the color of a roast is quite simple nowadays. Just prepare a sample and point your roast color meter at it. The device will display the roast color as a number. This may raise some questions.

- Why do different devices report different results on the same roast?
- What does the reported number mean and how does it compare?
- Why does the same device report different numbers for the same roast?

The post [Understanding Roast Color](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2023/03/understanding-roast-color.html) shares our observations from over 1000 color measurements taken with Tonino and Lighttells CM100+ roast color meters. Our results can help answer the above questions and may lead to better color measurements.
