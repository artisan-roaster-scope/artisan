Starting today the [artisan.plus inventory management service](https://artisan.plus/){:target="_blank"} is much more affordable for HOME roasters!

## HOME

We reduced the price of the [artisan.plus HOME subscription](https://shop.artisan.plus/en/home-roasters/artisan.plus-home-roaster-subscription){:target="_blank"} by 50% to now only **49.- / year**, limited to roasting 500kg (~1100lbs) green beans.

## HOME+

Further, we introduced the [HOME+ add-on](https://shop.artisan.plus/en/home-roasters/artisan.plus-home-1000kg-addon){:target="_blank"} which lifts the limit on HOME to 1500kg (~3300lbs), supporting small startups.
