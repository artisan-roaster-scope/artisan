We've got invited by [Royal Coffee](https://events.royalcoffee.com/){:target="_blank"} to hold an online workshop on Artisan. In this webinar Dave will show you how to access the wealth of information available in Artisan graphs. Whether during an active roast or reviewing a completed roast, Artisan has features to speed your work. 

Join Dave to learn the best ways to use Artisan to improve your workflow and improve your roasts in this informative session. Join the conversation, and get answers to your tough questions after the presentation in our Q&A session!

Roasting experience with Artisan is recommended but not required.

**UPDATE: a recording of this session is now available**
