Join us for this second [Royal Coffee](https://events.royalcoffee.com/){:target="_blank"} webinar on Artisan, where we will do a deep dive into the Analyzer and the Comparator tools.  

Dave Baxter will cover how these tools work, how to apply them and provide tips along the way to make them even easier to use. Great for both beginners and advanced Artisan users!


Roasting experience with Artisan is recommended but not required.
