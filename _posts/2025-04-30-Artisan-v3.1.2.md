Today we release [Artisan v3.1.2](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2025/04/artisan-v312.html){:target="_blank"}. Initially planned as a minor release to address a few specific issues that has been reported, things took an unexpected turn. In the end, we added several useful features to our so-called "free-but-limited approach."


Happy Roasting!
