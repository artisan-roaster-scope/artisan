[Artisan 4](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2026/01/artisan-4.html){:target="_blank"} marks the begin of a new generation.

- **Infrastructure**   
The infrastructure upon which Artisan is built has been upgraded. Consequently, older platforms such as Windows 8 and macOS 10.13 are no longer supported. On the positive side, this update enhances performance and stability while also resulting in smaller downloads.
- **User Interface**   
Artisan 4 introduces several new shortcuts, but it also introduces UI modes that simplify and improve usability, particularly in production environments.
- **Automation**   
The integrated PID controller was generalized to a two-degree-of-freedom PID controller, adding incorporated gain scheduling, bumpless transfer, and additional filtering capabilities.
- **Hardware Support**   
Support for the [RoastSee NEXT](https://lebrewtech.com/products/roastsee-next){:target="_blank"} live color reader from Lebrew and the [Acaia Pyxis Black](https://acaia.co/products/pyxis){:target="_blank"} scale has been added.
- **Roastetta**
A new [online repository for Artisan Scope roast profiles](https://www.roastetta.com/){:target="_blank"} has been established by Josh, which lets you upload, view, share and track roast charts.

We stay respectful, open and cooperative without the need for Non-Disclosure Agreements!    
For sure.
