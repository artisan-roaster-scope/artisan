Today we released [Artisan v3.4](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2025/10/artisan-v34.html){:target="_blank"}. 

Another significant update for Artisan in terms of features and technical advances.

- **Hardware Support**   
Support for a list of machines has been added or updated, including Kraffe, Berto, Nordic, Prisma, Cogen, Easyster, Toper, Sweet Coffee Italia, and Joper. Additionally, popular devices like the Shelly energy meters are now supported.
- **Roast Scheduling**   
The scheduler now permits modifications after a roast session has commenced, provides an estimate for the remaining roast duration, and its Batch Manager indicates states using the COSMO scales' built-in color LEDs.
- **Cropster Profile Import by drag-and-drop**   
Cropster's roast profiles exported as XLS files can now be imported by simply dropping them into the profile window.
- **Fermentation**   
Recordings can now span several days, with a sampling interval ranging from 0.1 seconds to over 16 hours. This makes Artisan suitable for controlling coffee fermentation experiments conducted at coffee origins.
- **Industrial PID Algorithm**  
The integrated PID now comes with several advanced features, including Integral Windup Prevention (IWP), derivative on measurement calculation (DoM), measurement discontinuity detection, derivative limiting, and enhanced setpoint change detection to prevent derivative kicks and spikes.
- **Revised Custom Buttons Mechanism**   
Custom button handling has been updated. For more information, refer to [Button Layouts and Hidden Buttons](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2025/10/button-layouts-and-hidden-buttons.html){:target="_blank"}.
- **Localizations**   
With the assistance of some excellent individuals, the Asian (Chinese and Korean) and Spanish localizations have been significantly enhanced. Additionally, Czech localization has been incorporated, and the support for Asian and Arabic default fonts has been improved as well.
