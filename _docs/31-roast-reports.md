### Reports

Menu: `File` >> `Save Graph`

*Saving Profiles in various formats*

You can save one graph under `File` >> `Save Graph`.  Multiple Artisan profiles can be converted into various other formats like CSV, PNG and PDF using `File` >> `Convert To`. Select the intended output format from the corresponding submenu, then select the Artisan profiles to be converted, along with the destination directory.   

Menu: `File` >> `Report` >> `Roast`

*Individual Roast Report*

You can also run individual roast reports.  These are useful for analyzing an individual roast.    There is a Chrome engine to render the HTML reports generated by Artisan to PDF. Now you can save those reports (menu File » Reports) directly as PDF. We also added the PDF Report option to the Autosave feature.

*Exporting Roast Reports and other data*

Under menu `File` >> `Export`, you can now export directly into Excel as well as Probat Pilot 1.4, Artisan CSV or JSON, or RoastLogger format.  The reports now include ROR and special event data as well.  Note that you can export your roast data and events using the "copy table" button on those tabs of Roast Properties.
