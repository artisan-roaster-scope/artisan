### Counting Batches

Menu>Config>Batch

Count batches so you can use that to determine maintenance needs, or other purposes.  Some use batch counts to identify samples or lots.  You will not see the batch count after pressing ON.  You will see it after pressing START and it will be confirmed after a DROP event.
