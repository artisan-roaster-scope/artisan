Motors and blowers that run continuously may be aggregated and entered as one load.<br><br>Loads are assumed to run continuously. Variable loads, such as the main burner setting, can be recorded in Artisan using one of the four special events.  The settings can be captured from a button, slider or in some cases read directly from the roaster.  The load setup allows linking a load to one of these events.  The energy calculator will then determine the setting percentage and the duration of the setting to calculate the energy consumed.<br><br>Burner entries require knowing the power rating of the burner.  Roasting machine manufacturer&#39;s typically provide this information.  If this information can not be found for your machine this table provides approximate values based on roaster capacities.  https://artisan-scope.org/ratings/<br><br>Energy Meters<br>Artisan allows the direct reading of 2 energy meters to support the use of measured energy consumption values in place of estimated values defined by the Loads. These energy meters could measure gas or electricity. As an energy meter the instantaneous power reading must be accumulated over a period of time.  Energy readings are typically in kWh or BTU, though other units are supported.  Artisan will use the Meter reading at the start of recording and end of recording to calculate energy consumption for the roast batch.  Intermediate reads at major roast events are also used in presenting phase energy consumption.  <br><br>Energy meter data must be recorded in an Extra Device (Config&gt;&gt; Devices&gt;&gt; Extra devices tab).  The Extra Device is then used as the Source for the meter in the Energy tab.  Connectivity to the meter is typically via MODBUS. Some devices, like the YoctoWatt, have direct connection support in Artisan.  The data recorded in the Extra Device must be scaled to one of the units supported in the Energy tab such as kWh, BTU, kJ, kCal or therms (thm).  For instance, an electricity meter that returns energy readings in Wh that must be scaled to kWh buy using the symbolic equation &quot;x/1000&quot;. </td>

This is useful when the 100% load setting is recorded as a different number in the Event.  For instance, maybe the burner event is recorded as 10x the kPa reading on the gas manometer.  An event value of 35 is recoded to signify 3.5 kPa, which is 50% pressure.  If the 100% burner setting corresponds to 7 kPa then the &#39;Value 100%&#39; should be set to 70, which is 7 * 10  = 70.  Thus 3.5 kPa will be seen by he energy calculator as 50%.  For pressure readings be sure to tick the Pressure box.
