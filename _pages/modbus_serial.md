The MODBUS RTU/ASCII protocols are communicated over a RS485 connection. This is usually connects via a serial RS485-to-USB converter to the computer.

You need to install the corresponding serial driver for the chipset of this converter on your PC, otherwise no serial port for the device is created by your operating system on connecting the machine. Most common drivers are

**Watch out!** The FTDI driver is preinstalled on virtually all Linux distributions as well as all OS X versions supported by Artisan. Installing an additional FTDI driver on those operating system might lead to instabilities!
