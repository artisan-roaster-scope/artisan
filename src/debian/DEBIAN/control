Description: Visual Scope for Coffee Roasters
 Artisan helps coffee roasters record, analyze, and control
 roast profiles. With the help of a thermocouple data logger, or a
 proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller), this software
 offers roasting metrics to help make decisions that influence the final coffee
 flavor.
