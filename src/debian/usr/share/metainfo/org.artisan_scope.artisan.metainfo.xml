        </ul>
        <p>CHANGES</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Phidget driver is now bundled with the Artisan app and no longer needs to be installed separately. NOTE: some legacy USB HID devices, like the original 1046 and 1048 still require the kernel extension of the driver package to be installed in the system.</li>
          <li>update volume not density if weight changes and volume is set in Roast Properties (Discussion #1786)</li>
          <li>generated WebLCD URL is using more stable host names instead of, potentially DHCP assigned, IP addresses</li>
          <li>updated Turkish translations (thanks to Kemal Akdas)</li>
          <li>raises max event button limits from 4 rows with maximal 30 buttons to 10 rows with maximal 50 buttons</li>
          <li>keeps custom events ordered by time</li>
          <li>events were replayed only if the corresponding event slider was visible in previous versions. Now events selected for replay are always replayed, independent of the visibility of the corresponding event slider.</li>
          <li>the parameters "max. number of custom buttons per row", "button size", "alternative slider layout", "mark last pressed" and "show tooltips" are now persisted per palette</li>
          <li>a click in a sliders pane no longer moves the slider, but just gives that slider the input focus (a click in a slider's bar still moves the slider to this position)</li>
          <li>the quick custom event entry using the q, w, e and e key followed by number keys now requires the ENTER/RETURN key to establish the new value.  The last entered digit can be removed by using the backspace key. ESC cancels the action.</li>
         <li>event replay at any time ensures that only future events are replayed. As the set of future events may change on moving the background profile, an event can still be replayed again. In previous Artisan versions, events did replay only once per roast.</li>
         <li>persist Energy Tab summary choice</li>
         <li>suppresses pick year from artisan.plus beans pop up and roast name suggestion if origin/name combination is unique</li>
         <li>improved accuracy on rendering artisan.plus blend component and schedule item weights</li>
         <li>improved Cropster importer</li>
         <li>the autosave mechanism will no longer save accidentally produced recordings on OFF lacking the CHARGE and DROP events. Note that that for roasts longer than 7min, the end of a roast is automatically added as DROP event on OFF, if no DROP event was set before.</li>
         <li>disables playback of DROP event, only active after CHARGE, for the first 7min into the roast</li>
         <li>restrict file selection to load background profiles to files with extension .alog</li>
        </ul>
        <p>FIXES</p>
        <ul>
          <li>fixes processing of MODBUS function 2 request which broke the just introduced autoCHARGE/autoDROP triggered by Loring machines</li>
          <li>ensure complete reset to defaults in energy tab loads tab</li>
          <li>makes loading of (broken) profiles with inconsistent data length more robust</li>
          <li>prevents exceptions caused by empty event type names (Discussion #1745)</li>
          <li>fixes a typo which allowed to open multiple Roast Properties dialogs (Issue #1781)</li>
          <li>fixes regression introduced in v3.0 which prevented the replay of events before CHARGE</li>
          <li>fixes an issue in event replay where certain events failed to be replayed by temperature</li>
          <li>fixes an issue where the PID Input for external MODBUS/SV PIDs was not correctly persisted</li>

          <li>fixes communication with some Santoker R Master Series machines (Issue #1811)</li>
          <li>fixes DROP being triggered by Kaleido machine on CHARGE (Issue #1808)</li>
          <li>ensures that projection lines are immediately redrawn after full redraw (Issue #1826)</li>
          <li>fixes a case where disconnecting from artisan.plus was not functional</li>
          <li>makes indication of artisan.plus connection loss more reliable</li>
          <li>list single blend with only replacement stock on artisan.plus if no other blend has stock which was not listed by error before</li>
          <li>fixes broken rendering of roasting times in CSV production reports</li>
          <li>remembered last batch size now correctly converted to current weight unit</li>
          <li>sliders send decimal values (instead of rounded integers via MODBUS, PWM, Artisan, WebSocket, IO, VOUT, S7 and RC Commands)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>REMOVALS</p>
        <ul>
          <li>support for the non-standard MODBUS little-endian byte order has been removed</li>
          <li>removes the experimental PID P-on-Measurement/Input mode (Issue #1744)</li>
