#### Artisan helps coffee roasters record, analyze, and control roast profiles. With the help of a thermocouple data logger, or a proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller), this software offers roasting metrics to help make decisions that influence the final coffee flavor.

Artisan is free for personal and commercial use, but asks for a [donation](https://www.paypal.me/MarkoLuther).
