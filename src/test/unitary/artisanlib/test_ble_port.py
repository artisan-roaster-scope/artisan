"""Unit tests for artisanlib.ble_port module.

This module tests the BLE and ClientBLE classes functionality including:
- BLE device scanning and discovery
- Connection and disconnection handling
- Data reading and writing operations
- Notification handling and callbacks
- Device description matching
- Async loop thread management
- Error handling and timeout management
- Heartbeat and keep-alive functionality
- Service and characteristic management
