# packages for RPi Raspbian Buster
#
# ensure that the selected version is on https://www.piwheels.org/ as binary package
# for the builds Python version 3.7.3 / Qt/PyQt 5.11.3
# ensure also that the dependency order is right (eg. gevent-websocket==0.10.1 is not on
# pywheel and requires gevent that is then also not taken from pywheel thus gevent-
# websocket has to be requested after the pywheel version of gevent)
