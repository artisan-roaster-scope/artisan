All Acaia scales are supported by Artisan including just introduced [Artisan Roasting Scales COSMO-10 and COSMO-100](https://acaia.co/products/cosmo-landing?srsltid=AfmBOop6vxt2frQz1TVPU4y8EN4dMqZu0pou18Xydi_cqkNvVvlKvyLS){:target='_blank'}. Up to two scales can be connected in parallel as configured under menu `Config >> Devices >> Batch Manager`.

Scale 1 can be used directly in the Roast Properties dialog (menu `Roast >> Properties) for weighing the green and roasted batch. The selected container weight is automatically subtracted. Note that the weight of a batch can be measured in parts too. The scale is also accessible in the [Volume Calculator](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2014/11/batch-volume-and-bean-density.html){:target='_blank'}.

Both scales can be used in combination with the [Batch Manager](https://doc.artisan.plus/docs/batch-manager/){:target='_blank'} to carry out all weighing tasks of the current [roast schedule](https://doc.artisan.plus/docs/schedule/){:target='_blank'}. The connected scales are automatically assigned to either the next green or roasted weighing task by placing a container.
