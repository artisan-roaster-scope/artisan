Phidgets modules offer reliable measuring for roast logging with Artisan. In general Phidgets are plug-and-play, providing high-resolution data at high-speed. 

Installation is simple!

1. Install the probes into the roasting machine
2. Connect the probes to the Phidget module
3. Connect the Phidget modules and wire them via USB to your PC
4. Install the Phidget driver
5. Install Artisan
6. Configure Artisan with one click

We describe here two basic setups that to our experience perform best. One setup is based on thermocouples (TCs) and a second, low-noise one, based on Resistive Thermal Devices (RTDs). For a technical discussion on the differences see *[On Idle Noise](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.com/2019/03/on-idle-noise.html){:target="_blank"}*. An additional set of modules can be added to either of these two setups, providing ambient data (humidity, barometric pressure and room temperature).

- [VINT TMP1101 2x TC Set](/phidgets/2x-tc-set/)
- [VINT TMP1200 2x RTD Set](/phidgets/2x-rtd-set/) (low-noise)
- [VINT Ambient Modules Extension](/phidgets/ambient-extension/)

All sets are based on modern [VINT](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/What_is_VINT%3F) modules as those provide additional flexibility, increased signal stability and generally consume less power from your USB port, in contrast to the direct-to-USB Phidgets (like the popular Phidget 1048 *databridge*)

Note that the sets use probes with a diameter of ø3.2mm which are considered slow by some. In the post linked above we argue that thinner probes have a worse signal-to-noise ratio, break regularly, and their speed advantage does not matter for the application in coffee roasting.

**Watch out!** 
The hardware parts of each set are available from [Phidgets.com](https://www.phidgets.com/){:target="_blank"}, one of their [resellers](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Dealers){:target="_blank"} or as a compiled ready-to-use package from the [Artisan shop](https://shop.artisan.plus/){:target="_blank"}.
